# Quiz App Documentation

### 1. Configuration
----
  - Change the JSON document (question set) source and UI labels by editing "source" -> "config.js".

### 2. Preparation
----
This is a quiz app (no interesting name yet) I developed in JavaScript â€” files generated by Gulp task runner. Here's some prerequistes for testing it in your local client's browser:

1. Have NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/) and Gulp (http://gulpjs.com/) installed on your computer
2. Download this Github repository (ZIP and extract if necessary)
3. Generate build directory in which to output a final "index.html" that sources from transpiled, minified and obfuscated JavaScript and compiled CSS from SASS.

### 2. Generation
----
 Mac/Unix users:
  - Launch the executable "build.sh" file to build "node_modules" and "build" directory (wait a couple of minutes for dependencies to download).
 
 Windows users:
   - Open Command Prompt and "cd" into the project directory
   - Enter the following:
   - ```sh
        $ npm install --only=dev
        $ SET NODE_ENV=production
        $ gulp
        ```

### 3. Use
----
  - Visit "localhost:3000" (or "127.0.01:3000") in your browser... et voila!


### 4. Publish

----


Go ahead and publish your project. I've issued a standard MIT license. This means there's very few restrictions in how its used/modified/distributed/etc. Although I would appreciate some credit in copyright/license notices in copies of your software. Thank you!
