Gulp.js
=========================================

This seed project was set up to get started with Gulp.js on future projects. It’s a great technology (build system/task runner) for automating tedious web dev tasks. Here’s how to get going:


* Download this ZIP and extract
* Run ‘npm install’ in CLI to install dependencies
* Change modes (production or development) with 'export NODE_ENV=production' in CLI
* Run ‘gulp’ in CLI to run default task(s)
* Open ‘Build’ directory and view output files in browser
